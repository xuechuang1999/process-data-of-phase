# Get the phase energy bar and structures

## 计算能量，获得相关数据。

`process_data_version__0.1.ipynb` used to process the data, get the relevant data.
> get the `structure_data_grouped_.csv` file and `different_xc_energy_data.csv` file.


use the `energy_bar.ipynb` to draw the energy bar.
> get `comparison_bar_chart.png` file, which is the energy bar of different phase with different functionals.

use the `draw_structure_version__0.1.ipynb` to draw the structures.
> get the structures of different phase.
